    it has been torn down, producing ``FATAL: exception not rethrown`` and a
    SIGABRT — even though every test passed. ``os._exit`` skips finalization
    entirely after the terminal summary and junit XML are already written,
    eliminating the spurious crash.

    ``pytest_unconfigure`` fires after every other hook (terminal summary,
    junitxml plugin, etc.), so output and side effects are preserved. We
    skip the bypass on failure so pytest's normal traceback machinery still
