"""Reaper election: only one worker per cluster sweeps dead workers.

Before the election, every worker reaped on every 5s tick, so a `WORKER_OFFLINE`
event fired once per live worker per death instead of once. The heartbeat now
takes a cluster-wide lease first and only the holder reaps; a non-holder returns
an empty reaped list and so emits nothing.

These assert the mechanism through the lease itself rather than by simulating a
dead worker — a raw write to the queue's SQLite file is not reliably visible to
the queue's own connections (different journal mode), so the reap's *effect*
cannot be observed from a test, but the election that gates it can.
