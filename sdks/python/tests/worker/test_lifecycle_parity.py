"""The lifecycle must behave identically whether a task is sync or async.

Every test here runs a real ``@queue.task()`` through a real worker, and is
parametrised over ``def`` vs ``async def``. That combination is the point: the
existing async tests drive ``AsyncTaskExecutor`` directly with a mocked queue, so
they cannot see whether a hook fired or a compensation context was set, and the
existing hook/saga/batch tests use a real queue but only sync tasks. Neither
shape catches a gap between the two dispatch paths.

Each test asserts on behaviour a caller was promised, not on which path ran, so
the same assertions hold before and after native async dispatch is activated.
That is also why none of them skip when the build lacks ``native-async``: the
``is_async=True`` cases then route through the blocking path, which is worth
asserting in its own right. Proving *which* path is live is a separate job, and
belongs to the canary that asserts coroutines run on the executor thread —
these tests deliberately cannot tell, and must not.

Tasks are declared before the worker starts on purpose: the scheduler registers
task policy once at worker boot, so a task declared afterwards silently falls
back to ``RetryPolicy::default()`` and ``max_retries=0`` is ignored.
