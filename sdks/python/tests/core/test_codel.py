"""S27 — opt-in CoDel load shedding.

Behavioral (timing-based): a slow task with concurrency 1 backs the queue up, so
later jobs' sojourn stays above target for a full interval and CoDel sheds the
stalest ones to the DLQ. The controller's algorithm itself is unit-tested in Rust
(``scheduler::codel``); here we assert the end-to-end shed path and its
invariants.
