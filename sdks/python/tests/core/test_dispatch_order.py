"""S25 — opt-in LIFO dispatch order.

Jobs are enqueued before the worker starts, so all pile up pending; a
concurrency-1 worker then dispatches them one at a time and we record the order.
Same-priority ties break by ``(scheduled_at, id)`` direction — with UUIDv7 ids,
LIFO is deterministically newest-first even when jobs share a millisecond.
