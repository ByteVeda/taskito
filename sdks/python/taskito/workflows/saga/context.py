A compensation task is invoked with three positional args:
``(forward_args: tuple, forward_kwargs: dict, forward_result: Any)``.
For everything else — the forward job's id, the workflow run id, the node
name — the framework also stashes a :class:`CompensationContext` in a
context variable so the compensator can introspect its environment without
needing extra parameters.
