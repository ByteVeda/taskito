"""Decision loop for the bare-metal autoscaler.

The HPA-style formula and stabilisation windows live here. Process
management is delegated to ``ProcessManager``; this module is concerned
with *how many* workers we want, not with spawning them.

The pure-function ``compute_desired_workers`` is the heart of the
decision logic — it has no side effects and no subprocess interaction,
so it's exhaustively tested in isolation.

    Two signals drive the target:

    * **depth_desired** — ``ceil(pending / target_queue_depth_per_worker)``.
      Closely tracks Kubernetes HPA's queue-depth scaler: every extra
      worker takes one ``target`` slice of pending jobs off the queue.

    * **util_desired** — ``ceil(current_workers * (utilisation /
      target_utilisation))``. The canonical HPA formula. When utilisation
      sits exactly at the target, this returns ``current_workers``.

    The maximum of the two signals is taken so the controller errs on
    the side of more capacity. Overload (running > capacity) forces an
    immediate +1 regardless of windowing.

    The tolerance band (default 10%) is applied last: if the desired
    count is within tolerance of current, return current unchanged so
