"""The lifecycle one task runs through, shared by both dispatch paths.

A task reaches the worker one of two ways: the blocking path, where Rust calls
the wrapped function on a pool thread, or native async dispatch, where the
executor awaits the coroutine on its own event loop. Everything between "we have
the arguments" and "we have a result" is identical, and lives here.

It lives here rather than in either caller because the two used to reimplement it
separately, and drifted: the native copy silently lost the queue hooks, the saga
compensation context, ``soft_timeout`` and per-item batch handling. One body
means a new lifecycle concern cannot reach one path and miss the other.

The callers keep only what genuinely differs — how arguments arrive, and how the
result is delivered:

===================  ==========================  =============================
                     blocking                    native async
===================  ==========================  =============================
payload/result       Rust calls the queue's      the executor calls them
                     (de)serializers             directly
delivery             return/raise to Rust        ``PyResultSender``
job context          ``_set_context`` (thread)   ``set_async_context`` (ctxvar)
===================  ==========================  =============================

The context split needs no handling here: ``JobContext._require_context`` reads
the contextvar first and falls back to the thread-local, so ``current_job``
resolves on either path.
