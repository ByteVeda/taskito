"""Worker subprocess lifecycle for the bare-metal autoscaler.

The two-step termination (``terminate()`` → ``wait(timeout)`` → ``kill()``)
follows the canonical Python subprocess pattern documented at
https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html — give the child a chance
to clean up, then escalate if it ignores SIGTERM.

The autoscaler intentionally manages independent OS processes rather than
threads within a single worker. Threads share a GIL; processes don't. For
horizontal scaling we want true parallelism, and we want each worker to
heartbeat independently so the controller can detect and replace crashed
workers via ``reap_dead()``.
