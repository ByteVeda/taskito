"""Reverse-order saga orchestrator.

When a workflow run with ``on_failure="fail_fast"`` and a non-empty
:attr:`_RunConfig.compensation_map` enters terminal failure, the tracker
hands control to this module. The orchestrator:

1. Transitions the run state to ``Compensating`` and emits
   ``WORKFLOW_COMPENSATING``.
2. Collects nodes that completed successfully and have a registered
   compensator. ``Pending``/``Ready``/``Failed``/``Skipped`` nodes are
   excluded — only ``Completed`` / ``CacheHit`` are compensable.
3. Groups the compensable nodes into reverse topological levels
   (leaves first, roots last) and dispatches each level as a parallel
   wave.
4. On each compensation completion, marks the node ``Compensated`` /
   ``CompensationFailed`` and advances when the wave is fully drained.
5. Finalizes the run to ``Compensated`` (every wave succeeded) or
   ``CompensationFailed`` (one or more compensations failed —
   subsequent waves are NOT dispatched, since compensation is
   best-effort and downstream undo may depend on upstream undo).

Idempotency: each compensation job is enqueued with
``idempotency_key=f"compensation:{run_id}:{node_name}"``. The first call
creates the job; a duplicate (e.g. after a tracker restart) hits the
existing partial-index dedup in all 3 storage backends and is a no-op.

Compensator contract: the framework calls
``compensator(forward_args, forward_kwargs, forward_result)``. The args
and kwargs come from the deferred-payload cache when the forward node
was deferred, otherwise from the forward job's stored payload looked up
through ``PyQueue.get_job``. ``forward_result`` is deserialized from
the forward job's stored result when present. Compensators that need
extra metadata (run id, node name, forward job id) can call
:func:`taskito.workflows.saga.current_compensation_context`.
