# Taskito core — language binding contract

What a new language shell (Python today; Node via napi-rs, Java via UniFFI/JNI next)
must implement or call to reuse this Rust core. The core is **binding-agnostic**:
`taskito-core`, `taskito-workflows`, `taskito-mesh` carry **no** `pyo3` dependency
(enforced in CI — see [Invariant](#invariant)). The Python shell lives in
`crates/taskito-python`; study it as the reference implementation.

## Invariant
The generic crates must never depend on `pyo3` or any language runtime. CI fails if
`pyo3` appears in the normal dependency tree of `taskito-core`, `taskito-workflows`,
or `taskito-mesh` (`cargo tree` is authoritative — you cannot `use pyo3` without
depending on it). Keep Python/Node/Java specifics in the shell.

## The payload is opaque
`Job.payload` and `Job.result` are `Vec<u8>` blobs. The core **never** interprets
them. Each shell serializes args/kwargs at enqueue and deserializes them in the
worker — using whatever serializer it wants. The Python shell defaults to cloudpickle
(Python-only). **Cross-language constraint:** a job enqueued by one language and run
by another requires both sides to use the wire envelope below.

## Wire envelope (cross-SDK payloads)
A wire payload is one tag byte followed by the codec body. The tag records which
codec produced the body, so any shell can dispatch a decoder (or reject clearly)
without out-of-band configuration:

| Tag    | Body        | Cross-SDK | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| `0x00` | native      | **never** — reject with a clear error | Language-native codec (e.g. pickle). Same-language producer/consumer only. |
| `0x01` | msgpack     | optional  | Legacy tagged format; shells MAY read it, SHOULD NOT write it cross-SDK. |
| `0x02` | CBOR (RFC 8949) | **default** | The cross-SDK wire format. |
| `0x03` | reserved    | —         | Tagged JSON (not yet specified). |
| `0x04+`| reserved    | —         | Future (protobuf, …). |

Untagged payloads predate the envelope and are same-SDK legacy; a shell MUST NOT
assume any tag discipline unless the task is configured with a tagged serializer
on both sides. (Sniffing is unsafe: raw msgpack/CBOR bodies can begin with any
byte value.)

**Why CBOR over JSON**: integers survive — JS `Number` is exact only to 2^53−1
while other languages carry 64-bit/unbounded ints; CBOR bignums round-trip them
losslessly. IANA tags also round-trip datetimes (tag 0/1), decimals (tag 4), and
byte strings without a hand-rolled registry. Mature codecs exist everywhere
(`cbor2`, `cbor-x`, `jackson-dataformat-cbor`, `fxamacker/cbor`, …).

**Call body** (`Job.payload`): a 2-element CBOR array `[args, kwargs]` — `args`
an array, `kwargs` a map (empty map when the language has no keyword arguments).
Job-scoped extras belong in the `metadata`/`notes` columns, not the payload.
Convention for cross-SDK tasks: prefer a single object argument
(`args = [ {…} ]`, `kwargs = {}`) — it maps cleanly onto every language's
handler-binding model.

**Result body** (`Job.result`): a bare CBOR value (no array wrapper).

**Cross-SDK rules**:
- A shell reading tag `0x00` on a payload it did not produce MUST fail with an
  error naming the tag, not a generic decode error.
- Producer and consumer of a task MUST be configured with the same wire
  serializer; the tag is a self-check, not a negotiation mechanism.
- Delivery-side semantics (retries, DLQ, acks) are unaffected — the envelope is
  purely a payload contract.

**Test vectors** (hex, `0x02`-tagged CBOR):
- call `f(1, "a")`, no kwargs → `02 82 82 01 61 61 a0` — `[ [1, "a"], {} ]`
- result `true` → `02 f5`
- big int `2^53` → `02 1b 00 20 00 00 00 00 00 00`

## Dispatch call sequence
1. Shell constructs `Storage` (SQLite default; `postgres`/`redis` features) — `storage/traits.rs`.
2. Shell constructs `Scheduler::new(storage, queues, SchedulerConfig, namespace)` — `scheduler/mod.rs`.
3. Shell implements `WorkerDispatcher` — `worker.rs`.
4. `Scheduler.run(job_tx)` polls + claims jobs and sends each `Job` over a
   `tokio::sync::mpsc::Sender<Job>` — `scheduler/poller.rs`, `scheduler/mod.rs`.
5. `WorkerDispatcher::run(job_rx, result_tx)` receives the `Job`, deserializes
   `job.payload`, looks the task up by `job.task_name`, runs it, and sends a
   `JobResult` back over a `crossbeam_channel::Sender<JobResult>`.
6. `Scheduler.handle_result(JobResult)` records the outcome in storage and returns a
   `ResultOutcome` — `scheduler/result_handler.rs`.
7. Shell maps `ResultOutcome` to its own events/middleware (Python: `py_queue/worker.rs`).

```
Storage ─▶ Scheduler.run ──tokio::mpsc<Job>──▶ WorkerDispatcher.run
                                                     │ deserialize payload, run task
                              ◀─crossbeam<JobResult>─┘
Scheduler.handle_result ─▶ ResultOutcome ─▶ shell emits events / middleware
```

## What a shell MUST implement
### `WorkerDispatcher` — `worker.rs`
| Method | Signature | Required |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| `run` | `async fn run(&self, job_rx: tokio::sync::mpsc::Receiver<Job>, result_tx: crossbeam_channel::Sender<JobResult>)` | yes |
| `shutdown` | `fn shutdown(&self)` | yes |
| `notify_cancel` | `fn notify_cancel(&self, job_id: &str)` | optional — in-process pools may no-op; out-of-process (prefork) must deliver a side-channel signal |

Channels: inbound `tokio::sync::mpsc::Receiver<Job>` (async); outbound
`crossbeam_channel::Sender<JobResult>` (sync, cloneable).

## Task errors (structured, cross-SDK)
When a task raises, the shell reports the failure as a **canonical JSON object**
serialized into `JobResult::Failure.error` (and thus into `jobs.error`,
`job_errors.error`, `dead_letter.error` — the storage layer never interprets it):

```json
{"errtype": "ValueError", "message": "bad value 42", "traceback": ["...frame...", "..."]}
```

- `errtype` — the exception's class name, as idiomatic per language (qualified
  where the language has a notion of it). Required.
- `message` — the human-readable message, verbatim (keeps `error_like`
  substring filters useful). Required, may be empty.
- `traceback` — array of strings, best-effort per shell; `[]` when the
  language/runtime can't provide frames. Required key.

**Fallback rule (readers)**: an error string that does not parse as a JSON
object with a `message` key is a plain legacy/system string and MUST be
surfaced as-is. Core-generated maintenance errors (timeouts, worker-death
recovery, expiry, cancellation) remain plain strings by design.

**Retry semantics**: `retry_on`/`dont_retry_on`-style filtering matches on the
live exception object before formatting — the stored string never drives retry
decisions.

**Test vector** (assert byte-exact in each shell's formatter):
input errtype `BoomError`, message `it broke`, traceback `["frame1", "frame2"]` →
`{"errtype":"BoomError","message":"it broke","traceback":["frame1","frame2"]}`
(JSON with those three keys in that order, no extra whitespace).

## Topic pub/sub (cross-SDK)
A subscription (`topic_subscriptions`) routes a topic's publishes to a subscriber.
Its `mode` column selects the delivery model; the core (`pubsub::publish_to_topic`)
owns both, so a shell only marshals arguments.

| `mode` | On publish | Consumption |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `fanout` (default) | one ordinary `jobs` row per active subscriber | the normal dequeue/dispatch path — each delivery is a job |
| `log` | one `topic_messages` row for the whole publish (O(1)) | the shell **pulls**: `read_topic_messages` → process → `ack_topic_cursor` |

A topic may mix both: a publish writes the log row once **and** fans out to any
fan-out subscribers.

**Fan-out `unique_key` salting** — the `jobs` unique index is global, so a shell
that keys a publish MUST salt the key per subscriber or all but one delivery is
deduped away. Salt = `<key>::<topic_len>:<name_len>:<topic><name>` (length
prefixes make it injective). Done in the core; a shell that builds `NewJob` rows
itself must match it.

**Log cursor rules** (`read_topic_messages`/`ack_topic_cursor`):
- Both are **log-subscription only** — a `fanout` subscription (even on a mixed
  topic) reads nothing and acks nothing (`false`). Enforced by a `mode = "log"`
  filter on both backends, so a shell can't accidentally leak the log to a
  fan-out subscriber.
- The **cursor is an opaque, monotonic token** — a shell stores and passes back
  the message `id`, never parses it. Its format differs by backend (UUIDv7 on the
  Diesel backends, a `<ms>-<seq>` stream id on Redis), like the `get_task_logs_after`
  cursor note.
- **Reads are exclusive** of the cursor and ordered oldest-first; the cursor is
  resolved server-side from the subscription row.
- **Ack is a high-water mark**: acking id `X` acks every message `≤ X`. Monotonic —
  acking an older/equal id is a no-op (returns `false`). Like a Kafka offset commit,
  the caller is trusted to pass back an id it actually read.
- Delivery is **at-least-once**: a consumer that reads but dies before acking
  re-reads those messages. The cursor read has no per-message ack (see below).
- **Retention** is min-cursor compaction: a message is dropped once every log
  subscriber on its topic has acked past it (Diesel deletes `id <= min(cursor)`;
  Redis `XTRIM MINID`). A topic with an unread subscriber keeps its backlog.
  Both backends also honor an optional per-message `expires_at` as a TTL safety
  net (Diesel deletes expired rows; Redis `XDEL`s expired stream entries), so a
  stalled or unread cursor can't block reclamation forever.

**Topic registry (declared topics)** (`declare_topic`/`get_topic`/`list_declared_topics`):
- By default a log message is stored only when a `log` subscription already exists
  at publish time (the **late-join boundary**). `declare_topic(name, "log",
  retention_ms)` records the topic so its publishes are retained **even with zero
  subscribers** — a consumer that subscribes later still reads them. Declaration is
  an idempotent upsert on `name`; re-declaring updates `retention_ms` and preserves
  `created_at`. `mode` is `"log"` (the only declarable mode today).
- `retention_ms` bounds a **sub-less** backlog: `publish_to_topic` stamps
  `expires_at = now + retention_ms` on the stored message when the topic has no live
  log subscriber, so the retention sweep reclaims it. Once a log subscriber exists,
  min-cursor compaction governs and the registry lookup is skipped (no extra query
  on the log-subscriber hot path). A shell only marshals `declare_topic`; the core
  owns the publish-time decision.
- Storage: the Diesel backends use a `topics` table (migration `m0006`); Redis uses
  a `topics` hash keyed by name. A shell surfaces `Topic { name, mode, retention_ms,
  created_at }`.
**Per-message ack** (`lease_topic_messages`/`ack_message`/`nack_message`):
- An opt-in **consumption choice** on a `log` subscription (not a registration
  flag): instead of the cursor read, a consumer *leases* messages and acks/nacks
  each individually, so a poison message never blocks its siblings.
- `lease_topic_messages(topic, sub, limit, visibility_ms, now)` returns up to
  `limit` **available** messages oldest-first — never delivered, or a prior lease
  that expired (`now`-relative) or was nacked and never acked — and (re)leases
  each for `visibility_ms`. In-flight (leased, un-expired) messages are skipped.
- `ack_message` ends a delivery (never redelivered); `nack_message` makes it
  available immediately (vs waiting out the timeout). Both return `false` when
  there is no un-acked delivery. An un-acked lease that times out is redelivered.
- Delivery state lives per `(subscription, message)`: Diesel `topic_deliveries`
  table (migration `m0007`); Redis a `pmdeliv:<topic>:<sub>` hash mirroring it.
- **Retention**: on a topic consumed purely per-message (every log sub has
  acked), a message is compacted once every per-message subscriber has acked it;
  a topic that mixes in a cursor subscriber falls back to `expires_at`. Its
  delivery state is dropped with it (Diesel deletes the rows, Redis `HDEL`s the
  fields). Both backends implement this — Diesel via `topic_deliveries`, Redis by
  scanning the `pmdeliv:*` hashes during the purge sweep. A shell only marshals
  the three calls; the core owns the state.

**Test vector** (assert byte-exact in each shell that salts keys itself):
key `evt-42`, topic `orders`, subscription `email` →
`evt-42::6:5:ordersemail`.

## Webhook subscriptions (cross-SDK)
Webhook delivery is a shell concern, but the subscriptions live in the shared
settings KV store, so a queue driven by more than one shell must agree on the
layout or each shell sees only its own hooks.

- **Key** `webhooks:subscriptions` — a single JSON **array** holding every
  subscription. Not one key per hook.
- **Row fields** (snake_case; timestamps Unix ms; timeout in **seconds**):
  `id`, `url`, `events[]` (empty = all), `task_filter` (`null` = all tasks),
  `headers{}`, `secret` (`null` = unsigned), `max_retries`, `timeout_seconds`,
  `retry_backoff`, `enabled`, `description`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- **Retry curve**: the Nth wait is `retry_backoff ** N` seconds, N counted from
  zero — default `2.0` gives 1s, 2s, 4s.
- **Tolerant reads, lossless writes**: a shell keeps a row whose fields or event
  names it does not model, and MUST carry those fields through when it rewrites
  the array — every mutation rewrites the whole list, so dropping them would
  destroy another shell's configuration.
- **Delivery log** is separate: key `webhooks:deliveries:<subscription_id>`,
  one JSON array per subscription, newest last.

## Types the shell produces / consumes
- **`Job`** — `job.rs`. Fields incl. `id`, `queue`, `task_name`, `payload: Vec<u8>` (opaque),
  `status`, `priority`, `retry_count`, `max_retries`, `timeout_ms`, `unique_key`,
  `metadata`, `notes`, `cancel_requested`, `namespace`. Timestamps are Unix ms.
- **`JobResult`** — `scheduler/mod.rs`. Enum: `Success { result: Option<Vec<u8>>, … }`,
  `Failure { error, retry_count, max_retries, should_retry, timed_out, … }`,
  `Cancelled { … }`. The shell builds this from task execution.
- **`ResultOutcome`** — `scheduler/mod.rs`. Enum the core returns: `Success`, `Retry`,
  `DeadLettered`, `Cancelled`. The core decides retry-vs-DLQ from the retry budget; the
  shell only dispatches events/middleware off it.
- **`SchedulerConfig`** — `scheduler/mod.rs`. Poll interval, `batch_size`, aging,
  reap/cleanup/periodic intervals, `result_ttl_ms`, DLQ auto-retry policy.

## `Storage` trait surface the shell calls — `storage/traits.rs`
Grouped by concern (enumerated, not exhaustive — read the trait):
- **Enqueue / dequeue**: `enqueue`, `enqueue_batch`, `enqueue_unique`, `dequeue`,
  `dequeue_from`, `dequeue_batch`, `dequeue_batch_from`.
- **Completion / retry**: `complete`, `retry`, `reschedule`, `get_job`, `list_jobs`.
- **Exactly-once claims**: `claim_execution`, `complete_execution`, `list_claims_by_worker`.
- **Worker lifecycle**: `register_worker`, `heartbeat`, `unregister_worker`, `reap_dead_workers`.
- **Cancellation**: `request_cancel`, `is_cancel_requested`, `mark_cancelled`.
- **Resilience**: `try_acquire_token` (rate limit), `count_running_by_task`, `stats_by_queue`.
- **Dead-letter**: `move_to_dlq`, `list_dead`, `retry_dead`.
- **Topic pub/sub**: `register_subscription`, `list_subscriptions_for_topic`, `unsubscribe`,
  `publish_message`, `read_topic_messages`, `ack_topic_cursor`, `topic_log_stats`,
  `declare_topic`, `get_topic`, `list_declared_topics`, `lease_topic_messages`,
  `ack_message`, `nack_message` (see
  [Topic pub/sub](#topic-pubsub-cross-sdk)).

## Lifecycle the shell drives
- **Startup**: `register_worker(worker_id, queues, …)`. Worker ID is generated by the shell.
- **Heartbeat**: call `heartbeat(worker_id, resource_health_json)` on an interval
  (Python uses a daemon thread, ~5s). `resource_health` is arbitrary JSON the core stores
  without parsing — schema is the shell's choice.
- **Shutdown**: `unregister_worker(worker_id)`.
- **Cancellation handshake**: producer calls `request_cancel(job_id)`; an in-process
  worker observes it via `is_cancel_requested(job_id)` polling, or an out-of-process
  worker via `notify_cancel`; on observe, the shell calls `mark_cancelled(job_id)`.

## Python assumptions in the core (none structural)
All clean — `payload`/`result`/`task_name` opaque, channels standard, `Storage`
fully abstract, three interchangeable backends. The only Python mentions left are
doc-comments pointing at the Python shell as the *example* binding; no code path
assumes a serializer, a runtime, or a middleware framework.
