//! The settings KV doubles as the store for auth state, webhook subscriptions,
//! and the retention windows a cleanup leader publishes. None of those belong on
//! a dashboard's generic key/value surface: reading them leaks credentials and
//! writing them spoofs a published policy. The canonical list lives here so that
//! every binding hides the same keys instead of re-deriving it — a prefix missed
//! in one shell reopens the hole for all of them.

/// Key prefixes a shell's generic settings API must treat as absent — never
/// listed, read, written, or deleted through it. The runtime's own readers and
/// writers use the [`Storage`](crate::storage::Storage) settings methods, which
/// stay unrestricted.
